            <h2>Energy Efficient Networking Starts with Big Data Centers</h2>
            <p class="writing-description">
                A research paper analyzing the environmental impact of modern data centers and evaluating
                three possible approaches to meeting society’s growing digital demands. The paper argues
                that hyperscale data centers—when paired with renewable energy, advanced cooling systems,
                and AI-driven thermal management—offer the most sustainable and efficient solution for
                large-scale data processing. Drawing on industry reports and academic research, it
                highlights how centralized cloud infrastructure can reduce waste, improve energy usage,
                and even operate carbon-negative under the right conditions.

            <h2>Shifting Brick-and-Mortar Retail Operations to the Cloud</h2>
            <p class="writing-description">
                A professional memo and white paper analyzing the outdated technological infrastructure of
                Times R Us, a fictional national retail chain. The paper outlines how legacy servers,
                inefficient inventory processes, and a lack of online presence are costing the company
                millions in lost productivity and missed opportunities. It recommends a full cloud migration
                strategy—including SaaS for communications, IaaS for data storage, cloud-based inventory
                systems, and a PaaS-driven mobile app—to modernize operations, reduce costs, and meet
                modern consumer expectations.

            <h2>Lost in the Clouds? Security Trade-Offs of Cloud Migration</h2>
            <p class="writing-description">
                A professional memo evaluating the security implications of moving on-premises systems to a
                commercial cloud provider. Written for a fictional Chief Security Officer, the memo compares
                the control and isolation of on-site infrastructure with the redundancy, encryption, and
                advanced protections offered by modern cloud platforms. It highlights risks such as internal
                threat actors, outdated email systems, and single points of failure, while demonstrating how
                reputable cloud vendors like AWS, Azure, and Microsoft 365 provide stronger, more scalable
                security solutions. The memo concludes that cloud migration offers a net security benefit
                alongside major cost and productivity gains.
