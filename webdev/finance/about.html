            <h2>President Luke</h2>
                <img src="img/luke.jpg" alt="Picture of Luke"/><br>
                <p class="textShortener">Luke is one of Wall Street's biggest names. He made his fortune by investing in such corporate powerhouses as Emery's Emery Boards and Kim's Kimonos. Luke's investment strategy of exploiting people's desperate need for smooth nails and Japanese festival wear was considered controversial to some, but it has paid massive dividends to those who took his advice. Luke decided to start this company to help those he felt were in need of financial assistance. For the low price of only $100 a day you can get thousands of dollars in returns.</p>

                <img src="img/john.jpg" alt="Picture of John"/><br>
                <p class="textShortener">Johnny went from detention to jail to real estate to Wall Street. Johnny has taken some bad beats in the market but also found some success as well. His big gamble on his namesake corporation was a tough loss, but betting on the resurgence of kimonos has turned things around. He's betting on them to succeed again now that Japanese anime has taken over the U.S. box office.</p>

Mikey has seen much success as of late with a wise investment in Mike's Mikes. Mikey and Mike's Mikes made money by means of Mickey's misstep.

When Stevie is not at the local tavern or protesting against anti-poaching laws, he can be seen stumbling through the streets shouting about how the path to financial success is paved with nickels. Stevie is betting heavy on Nick's this year. He has already invested two video games in the company and is encouraging others to see the ways of Nick.</p>

<!-- This is the page where I tell about the company employees. I used aboutbutton for the buttons and ended up using that style across the site. Hence why so many buttons are named aboutbutton. Same with aboutCard for the display areas. The rest are just id's for the different employee displays. -->
