                <div id="chart"></div>
                <p class="textShortener">Mike's rose today because news broke that Mickey's Mikes would not be able to completely fulfill its contract with the Pawnee Harvest Festival. Chris Traeger said it was "literally, the worst news he's ever gotten." Leslie Knope called the news "disappointing." Mike's is expected to receive a hefty contract. Mickey could not be reached for comment.</p>

                <div id="chart2"></div>
                <p class="textShortener">Nick's rose today on news that his Aunt would be giving him $15 for his birthday. Nick's business strategy of buying nickels for five cents and then selling them for five cents has scared away many investors as of late, but the news of his birthday money was welcome news to long-time supporters of the company. Nick's Aunt had not invested in the company since last Christmas. Wall Street insiders are saying there are rumors she will make a similar investment this year.</p>

                <div id="chart3"></div>
                <p class="textShortener">Ollie's rose today after the revival of Marty's Martini Convention in Connecticut was announced. Green Olives should be in high demand once thirsty chilled vodka connoisseurs start to gather in Stamford. What should have been big gains were negated by news that the notorious olive burglar struck again. This makes 14 olive robberies in the last three weeks. Authorities are baffled.</p>

                <h3>Pete's Pizza</h3>
                <img class="picSizer" src="img/chart4.jpg" alt="Guess What? A Picture of a Stock Chart"/><br>
                <div id="chart4"></div>
                <p class="textShortener">Pete's pizza suffered heavy losses again today after being unable to meet pizza demand due to an ongoing conflict between tomato growers in Indiana and California. Indiana recently dropped Agent Orange on over 4000 square miles of California tomato groves. California has responded by stealing Peyton Manning's dog. The Indiana governor has denounced the dognapping and has promised retaliatory strikes.</p>
