            <h2>Invest in the S&P500</h2>

                <img class="picSizer" src="img/money.jpg" alt="Money Pile">
                <p class="textShortener">Wealth around the world has been concentrating at the top forever. You have two choices: you can sit in the corner and whine and cry, or you can join the party. One of the best ways to join the party is to invest in the S&P500 index fund. This fund tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, providing broad market exposure and diversification. Historically, the S&P500 has delivered an average annual return of around 14%, making it a solid choice for long-term investors. What this means for you is your money essentially doubles every five years.</p><br>
                <h3>How your money grows:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age 20: $20,000</li>
                    <li>Age 25: $40,000</li>
                    <li>Age 30: $80,000</li>
                    <li>Age 35: $160,000</li>
                    <li>Age 40: $320,000</li>
                    <li>Age 45: $640,000</li>
                    <li>Age 50: $1,200,000</li>
                    <li>Age 55: $2,400,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="textShortener">That seems like a long time, but it isn't. When you are 55 and all your chump friends are still working with busted knees and bad backs, you will be sitting on a beach, earning $336,000 a year for doing nothing. Put your money in the S&P and leave it there!!!</p>

            <h2>Don't Eat Lunch!!!</h2>

                <img class="picSizer" src="img/lunch.jpg" alt="A picture of lunch">
                <p class="textShortener">I am always telling my nephew; there are two types of people in this world: winners and lunch eaters. Which one do you want to be? Winners don't have designated lunch times every day. Not only is it a huge loss of productivity, it is expensive. Do you want to be paying $25 for some gross carrot sandwiches, or do you want to put that money in the S&P500 and watch it grow? A winner eats when they can. They have a big breakfast and hearty dinner AFTER they have finished working for the day. They don't just stop what they are doing in the middle of the day and leave their business to go get some fast food. Be a winner. Skip lunch.</p>

            <h2>Invest in Companies That Society Needs to Survive</h2>

                <img class="picSizer" src="img/bomb.jpg" alt="A picture of a nuclear bomb">
                <p class="textShortener">Microsoft literally cannot fail. If Microsoft and all its products were to suddenly disappear from the planet the resulting chaos would be worse than a nuclear bomb going off in New York City. They're too big. Too many different people and industries depend on them. They're an obvious example, but there are quite a few others. Especially now that we live in, and depend on, a digital world.</p>
                <p class="textShortener">Take Qualcomm for example. They make chips that go in almost every wireless communication device on the planet. They are the only ones who make the chips that are required for smartphones to communicate. Whether you use Samsung or Apple or Huawei, you use Qualcomm. You may not see as big of a return as Nvidia, but you will see consistent returns that will beat any HYSA or bond and most real estate investments.</p>
                <p class="textShortener">These are the companies to pad your portfolio with and help you weather the bad S&P500 years.</p>
