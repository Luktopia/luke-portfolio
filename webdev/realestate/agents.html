        <h2>Johnny Johnson</h2>
        <img class="imgSmall" src="img/agents-johnny.jpg" alt="Picture of guy with tattoos leaning over rail"/><br>
        <cite>https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-in-black-crew-neck-top-leaning-on-metal-fence-3214772/</cite><br>
            <p class="pText">Although Johnny has been described as tough to get along with, unpredictable, and violent, one can not argue with his work ethic. During the 15 years he was incarcerated at Rikers Island Prison for manslaughter, Johnny never missed a day of work in the cafeteria. Not even when his cellmate was found shanked. Johnny's loving outbursts and tendency to get sellers to meet his buyer's demands have made him an integral part of the Luke's Real Estate Company Team. If you are looking for a home buying experience that is anything but boring, give Johnny a call today.</p>

        <h2>Stevie Stevenson</h2>
        <img class="imgSmall" src="img/agents-stevie.jpg" alt="Man drunk on couch"/><br>
        <cite>https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-tired-man-in-white-long-sleeves-resting-on-a-couch-while-holding-a-glass-of-whisky-13027758/</cite><br>
            <p class="pText">Stevie is a thrice divorcee and, like most realtors, Stevie is a severe alcoholic. Stevie's motto is, "All that's worth knowing in life can be found at the bottom of a bottle." When Stevie is not fighting the shakes or passed out in an alley, Stevie is working for you. Although he might stumble a little more than most, Stevie is an expert tour guide that is more than capable of unlocking the front door and sitting in the kitchen while you and your family look around your next potential dream house. Depending on whether or not Stevie made a sale recently, you can either find him at Richard's Pub or hanging out in front of the liquor store begging for a pint of vodka. Find Stevie today!!!</p>

        <h2>Willie Williamson</h2>
        <img src="img/agents-willie.jpg" alt="Dude with a beard"/><br>
        <cite>https://pixabay.com/photos/beard-face-man-model-mustache-1845166/</cite><br>
            <p class="pText">Willie has a beard. Willie is very proud of his beard. Willie is one of those guys that spends several hours every week grooming his beard. Willie's beard is almost an extension of his own work ethic. Meticulous and perfection oriented. Willie's co-workers find him insufferable, but you might not. You may be the kind of person who thinks smoking American Spirits, drinking PBRs, and shopping at thrift stores makes you random and cool. If so, Willie is the agent for you.</p>
