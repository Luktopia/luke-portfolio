    <h1>Cash Buyers Aren't Cool, They're Stupid</h1>

        <p class="pText">Before we talk about how insanely stupid it is to pay cash for a house, let's first talk about the difference between rich people vs. wealthy people. Rich people buy expensive things and use their money as a sign of their success. Wealthy people buy what they want and realize that money makes you a target. Wealthy people don't use their money on boats and expensive jewelry, they use their money to make money. That's why you will never see a wealthy person pay cash for a home. (Note: There are different levels of wealth. Very few wealthy people fall into the extremely wealthy category, but for those that do, these rules don't apply)</p>

        <p class="pText">When you see a person brag about paying cash for a home, that person is rich. Chances are, they won't stay that way. Wealthy people almost never become poor. Rich people become poor all the time.</p>

        <p class="pText">So, why is buying a house with cash considered stupid? Because there are so many other things that you could do with that money!!! Think about this: The average return on money invested in the S&P500 is 14% per year. Even now, with mortgages at high rates, a mortgage rate will only cost you 7%. You don't have to be a math wiz to surmise that 14 is a bigger number than 7. Simply setting up a Robin Hood account and putting that 500k in VOO will earn you a free 7% on your money per year. COMPOUNDING!!!! The idiot that threw all their money into a house earns NOTHING. They may have saved money, but chances are they're just going to blow the money they saved on a Cyber Truck or something stupid.</p>
        
        <p class="pText">BUT WAIT, THERE"S MORE. Once you put all that money into the house it's gone. If that rich dude's nightclub fails and he needs money to pay the property taxes, what's he going to do? Wait months while he sells the home and pays Luke's Real Estate Company 5% to do so? What about a medical expense? What about if he wants to invest in other properties? Wealthy people often have tons of loans going at once. The banks are happy to give it to them because they know they have the equity to pay them back. You will NEVER see a real estate investor paying cash for a home, so why do you think you should?</p>

        <p class="pText">In summary, the next time some big shot starts talking tall about how they paid cash for their home, laugh in their face and repeat everything I just told you. Watch and giggle as they try to to explain how they didn't want the burden of paying a mortgage. (Oh no, the auto withdraw from my bank account is so stressful)</p>
