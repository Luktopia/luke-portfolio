    <h2>Homer Glen Home</h2>
    <img src="img/listings-homer.jpg" alt="Suburb Family Home"/><br>
        <cite>https://pixabay.com/photos/driveway-house-suburb-family-home-3240834/</cite><br>
        <p class="pTextList">Homer Glen is an up and coming area. 15 years ago, it was pretty barren, but today, it is popping hard. Cheap homes on the very edge of Chicago's urban sprawl ended up being a good investment. Who could have guessed that? Probably the best thing to come out of this boom is the fast food paradise that is 143rd and Bell Rd. Get this, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Dairy Queen, Jimmy Johns, Dunkin, Wendy's, White Castle, Arby's, Brown's Chicken, Pizza Hut, and Culver's are all right there!!! Whenever I head over I never get just one. A Big Mac and few sliders. A box of Brown's and a Dave's Double. The possibilities are endless.</p>

    <h2>Alsip Home</h2>

        <p class="pTextList">You want to know what you're getting if you buy a house in Alsip? You're getting character. You're getting guile. You're getting Swap-O-Rama. Have you ever been to Swap-O-Rama? It's awesome. You can go there, get some brass knuckles, a spiderman mask, an order of perogies, and a pair of used rollerblades for like $35. Hard to beat that deal. There's a lot of crap that you can find cheaper on AliExpress, but overall it's pretty cool. Just look for the Alsip water tower. Swap-O-Rama is right under it.</p>

    <h2>Hinsdale Home</h2>
    <img src="img/listings-hinsdale.jpg" alt="Huge Mansion"/><br>
        <cite>https://pixabay.com/photos/mansion-england-estate-3431460/</cite><br>
        <p class="pTextList">You probably can't afford Hinsdale. This is where the wealthy people live. It seems like it wouldn't be worth it. You are paying 5x per square foot that you would be paying in Homer Glen. You are not paying for the home, though. You are paying for the connections that you gain by living there. A hard life fact is that who you know is a lot more valuable than what you know. Hinsdale is the place to go if you want to meet people to know.</p>

    <h2>Naperville Home</h2>
    <img src="img/listings-naperville.jpg" alt="Upscale Suburban Home"/><br>
        <cite>https://pixabay.com/photos/luxury-home-upscale-architecture-2409518/</cite><br>
        <p class="pTextList">You probably can't afford Naperville either. However, unlike Hinsdale, you don't want to. Rich people live in Naperville. Do you know where the guy who has the temporarily hot place to be goes to buy a home with cash? Naperville. It's because he's a jerk. He will find himself right at home in Naperville. I once had a woman cry her eyes out at the bar I was working at in Naperville because we didn't carry the unusual vodka she insisted on drinking. Apparently, I ruined her birthday. That's the type of people you will meet in Naperville. Don't buy in Naperville.</p>
