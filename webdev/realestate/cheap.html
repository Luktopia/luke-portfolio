        <h2>Don't buy, your dream home, build it yourself</h2>

        <p class="pText">Buying a house is like buying a suit. It doesn't matter how nice the suit is, you're going to have to get it tailored. When I show homes I am constantly pointing out flaws. Things that need to replaced. Things that the owner probably thinks very highly of, but became obsolete or went out of style two decades ago. The point is, every home is going to need some renovation to fit the new owner's tastes. So, what do you do?</p>

        <p class="pText">You could build new. That's what I would recommend to a person with unlimited funds and time. That's not everyone though. That's why for your common person, I would recommend a fixer upper.</p>
        
        <p class="pText">Look at the picture above. That house looks pretty run-down, huh? Doesn't look like a place you would want to buy, huh? Wrong. Look at the house on the left. You can only see a little. You can tell it is in significantly better condition. It would probably be listed for double the house featured in the photo. It would not take anywhere near that amount to fix it up.</p>
        
        <p class="pText">It's the same concept as flipping a house. Only you don't sell it. You live in it. The basic concept is, if you are willing to buy a house and wait three months to move in while your contractors gut and rebuild the interior, you can get a basically new custom version of your home for 75% of the cost. Seems like a no-brainer right?</p>
