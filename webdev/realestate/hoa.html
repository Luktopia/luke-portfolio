    <h1>HOAs Are Great For Home Owners</h1>

        <p class="pText">The internet is filled with cry babies. For all the great things it has done, it has also perpetuated the spread of disinformation at a rate unheard of in human history. While all information has the possibility to spread, nothing spreads faster than victimhood. "This bad thing happened to me, spread the word or it will happen to you!!!" This can be a very good thing, but it can also lead to a lot of misinformation. I like to say, "The more you read about things you know on the internet, the less you will believe what you read about things you don't know on the internet." HOAs are a perfect example of this.</p>
        
        <p class="pText">It seems like everyone is against HOAs these days. Just type "HOA stories" into Google and see what comes up. Tale after tale of poor little homeowner Billy getting the shaft from his HOA for his lawn being a half an inch too long. The way HOAs are portrayed, you would think everyone that lives in one would have their own story to tell. That's what funny though, in my 20 years as a licensed realtor I have never heard a firsthand account of a HOA horror story. It's almost as if the things you read on the internet do not necessarily reflect the things you experience in real life.</p>

        <p class="pText">Here's the skinny, HOAs are great for homeowners. They are safer. They are nicer looking. They are more expensive. The value of homes in HOA neighborhood increases at a rate that is much higher than non-HOA neighborhoods. Do you want to know why? Because everyone wants to live there. That neighborhood with a park in the middle for kids to play in? That's an HOA neighborhood. That neighborhood with a lake that has a fountain in the middle of it? That's an HOA neighborhood. </p>

        <p class="pText">So why all the hate? Why do people continually buy into the anti-HOA propaganda? The answer is simple. More likely than not the people spreading this hate are either misinformed children or just plain bad neighbors.</p>
        
        <p class="pText">If you don't want to cut your lawn or pitch in fifty bucks a month for shared community resources, that's fine. You can live in a non-HOA neighborhood. There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't mean they are automatically worse than HOA neighborhoods. It just means that your neighbors can do anything they want, as long as it's not illegal. It's not illegal to have six dogs peeing around your yard, or to have a car on blocks in your front yard, or to have a lawn that is 6 inches tall. It's not illegal to have a house that looks like it was built by Willy Wonka. That can wreck absolute havoc on your resale value.</p>

        <p class="pText">Just remember, before you go out of your way to avoid HOA neighborhoods, know that most people who live in HOA neighborhoods wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
