    <p class="pText">Luke's Real Estate Company has a long and storied tradition. It was started in 98,000 B.C. by Oog, a local caveperson living in the Chicago area. When Oog was asked, "Why call it Luke's? Who is Luke?" Oog simply stated, "One day Luke will come to lead us in the ways of real estate." To the surprise of no one, Luke did come. After his birth, almost 100,000 years after Oog's prophecy, Luke finally took control of Luke's Real Estate, the biggest real estate company in the galaxy.</p>

        <p class="pText">"When I heard that Luke defeated Bobdogg and Big Nicky T at Star Wars Monopoly I knew he was the right agent to sell my townhouse. His strategy of selling off the overrated green and blue properties to focus on the orange and maroon properties is the right one to take. I asked Luke what he thought I should list my townhouse for. He responded, "Vern, did you know that if you own all four railroads you get $200 every time someone lands on a railroad" I told him I didn't know that, but I was glad he told me. Two weeks later he traded my townhouse for Short Line Railroad, Tennessee Avenue and St. James Place. I couldn't be happier."</p>

        <p class="pText">"When we were looking to buy our first big-top we knew we couldn't just choose any realtor, we needed someone to suit our specific needs. We asked the bearded lady who she had bought her ring toss trailer from and she told us about Mikey Michaelson from Luke's Real Estate Company. Suffice to say we were beyond excited. Having someone who shares our unique world vision was essential to finding the property of our dreams and Mikey was that someone. Not only did he find us a tent capable of holding our trapeze set, but he also squirted the seller's agent with seltzer water until he knocked 5% off the price. We love Mikey and we love Luke's Real Estate!"</p>

        <p class="pText">"I saw a picture of Luke online and I couldn't stop thinking about him. Every night he ran through my head until I fell asleep. I finally called Luke's Real Estate and set up an appointment to look at some homes. I didn't even need a new home, but I knew I wanted to be close to Luke. I ended up buying two condos and an empty lot. I don't really use them, but I am so happy with Luke's service I think I am going to buy a strip mall in Berwyn."</p>
